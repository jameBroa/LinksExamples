# LinksExamples
This repo contains several Links files which were used to test the capability of <a href="https://github.com/jameBroa/LinksLSP">LinksLSP</a>. Most files in this repo don't do anything meaningful. Rather, they exist to cover the various ways Links can be written. Feel free to use this repo as a resource to learn Links or to test <a href="https://github.com/jameBroa/LinksLSP">LinksLSP</a> yourself.

## Important
It is possible some of the Links files here aren't written correctly. As a result, they are not sound and won't compile. The easiest way to test this is true or not is by seeing if the file runs via: `linx {links_file_dir}`
